Blue LED Transilluminator Project Kicks Off
A transilluminator is iften used in gel electrophoresis studies to visualize proteins, DNA, RNA or their precursors. It requires the UV light to be directed towards, but the whole of the UV source is not cobered by the material that is being irradiated.
The materials required include:UV blue LEDs; power supply (9V; switch; light difuser and a blue light filter. 
We were successful in building a circuit and putting the light on and off with a switch directly connected to the power source in the first day.
We then transferred out circuit from a bread board onto a peff board pending soldering.
