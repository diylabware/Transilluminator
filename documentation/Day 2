Challenges: Coding has been a major challenge in day 2 and we hope to overcome this the coming days.

Lessons learnt:
Basic electronics
ohms law and its practical application, resistors, capasitors: Reading a resistor
sensors (stand alone and sensory array)
how to use a multimeter
Atuators: These are responsible for moving or controlling a mechanism or system. E.g Servo motor
Effectors: Any device that is able to cause changes to its environment 
Microcontrollers:A computer present in a single integrated circuit which is dedicated to perform one task and execute one specific application. They contain;
menory, more economical; operating at a low clock rate frequency and design for low power consumption; they vary in archetecture; and used in situations where limited computer function are needed.
We again learnt about Single Board Computers
Creating a github account and how to navigate it
The key things in git hub include: Readme, Contributions and Roadmap
